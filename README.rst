Lancet
======

**Launch jobs, organize the output, and dissect the results.**

More information about Lancet may be found on `Lancet's website
<http://ioam.github.io/lancet/>`_. Here you may find a quickstart
example, user documentation, tutorials as well as more information
about publications involving Lancet.

To obtain Lancet from GitHub::

   git clone git://github.com/ioam/lancet.git

In common with many projects on `IOAM <https://github.com/ioam>`_,
Lancet uses `param <https://github.com/ioam/param>`_, so make sure to
install it with ``pip install param``.

Introduction
____________

Lancet is designed to help you organize the output of your research
tools, store it, and dissect the data you have collected. The output
of a single simulation or analysis rarely contains all the data you
need; Lancet helps you generate data from many runs and analyse it
using your own Python code.

Parameter spaces often need to be explored for the purpose of
plotting, tuning, or analysis. Lancet helps you extract the
information you care about from potentially enormous volumes of data
generated by such parameter exploration.

Features
________

* A simple, useful core with advanced functionality strictly
  optional. Use what you need without learning all components.

* All components use a declarative style, helping to ensure
  reproduciblity.

* Succinctly express the high dimensional parameter spaces, without
  nested loops.

* Easily interface with external tools using ShellCommand or quickly
  build a flexible, reusable interfaces to advanced simulators or
  analysis tools. Currently, the Topographica neural simulator is
  actively supported.

* Seamlessly switch from running jobs locally to launching jobs on a
  compute cluster.

* Keep your output organized together with key metadata for
  reproducibility.

* Quickly load your data and view the parameters from previous runs.

* Integrates well with other popular tools such as IPython Notebook
  and the pandas data analysis library.

* Actively used in scientific research and publication.
